# CSCE 642 Semester Project - Autonomous Driving Simulation

## Overview

## Getting Started

### VISTA Simulator
For this project we are using the VISTA simulator to train our vehicle agent in a virtual environment. VISTA is a data-based simulator that provides a flexible API to render environments and train models. 

Learn more about VISTA here:
https://vista.csail.mit.edu/ 

Setup VISTA following the instructions link below (**NOTE:** To create a Conda environment download the environment.yaml file from the VISTA GitHub repository [HERE](https://github.com/vista-simulator/vista/tree/main)).

We recommend not using the conda method as the environment.yaml file provided is outdated. The other method where you install each library individually using pip in a venv gives a usable environment. For each package installed, reference the environment.yaml to get the proper version since Vista does not work on all up-to-date versions.
